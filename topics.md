# Breakout Sessions!
Time to choose what to learn! Here are some suggested topics:

1. Pre save functions using `mongoose`
2. A quick, **RESTful** API
3. Server-side `templating` (`ejs`, `pug.js`)

Class chosen topics:
- +1 to #2
- +1 to #3

Ultimatum: Let's build cool sh*t, namely a restful API with server side templating.

Brandon's Steps to easy-peasy express servers:

- If you are brave, `touch server.js`. What this does is make `npm init` pre-populate the `entryPoint` property of your `package.json`
- Install dependencies:

```bash
    $ npm i --save express morgan body-parser colors mongoose ejs
```

- Look at server.js ;)

- Server side templating: make a `views` folder
